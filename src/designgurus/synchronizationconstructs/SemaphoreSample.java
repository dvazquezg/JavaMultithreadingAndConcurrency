/**
 * Note: AtomicInteger in Java provides a thread-safe way to perform operations on an int value
 * without requiring explicit synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks or locks. It
 * achieves this primarily through the use of Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operations, which are
 * low-level, atomic CPU instructions.
 *
 * <p>Note 2: Do you need a Semaphore here? Usually, no. AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet() (or
 * addAndGet(), compareAndSet()) are already atomic and lock-free. Adding a Semaphore just to
 * protect increments would make things slower, because weâ€™re layering lock-based coordination on
 * top of already thread-safe operations. This is for demonstration purposes.
 *
 * <p>Note 3: Semaphore vs Fixed Thread Pool - difference at a high level:
 *
 * <p>Fixed Thread Pool (ExecutorService with fixed size) Controls the number of worker threads that
 * can run tasks concurrently. Tasks beyond the limit wait in a queue until a thread becomes
 * available. Focus: managing task execution.
 *
 * <p>Semaphore Controls the number of threads that can access a particular resource or critical
 * section at the same time. Threads not allowed to proceed block until permits are available.
 * Focus: managing access to resources.
 *
 * <p>Example to illustrate: If you want at most 5 tasks running in parallel, use a fixed thread
 * pool. If you have unlimited tasks, but only 3 database connections, you might use a semaphore
 * with 3 permits to guard the database connection pool.
